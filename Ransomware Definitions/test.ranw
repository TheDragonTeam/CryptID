		       This is just a test ransomware for and from CryptID. It does not do any harm and just changes file extensions of your files.

		         You can clean up the file extension mess by downloading CryptID at https://cryptid.thedragon.team. After you have downloaded it, run it, select Full Scan and click Run Decryptor at the results page. This will change your file extensions back to normal.

		           To test an other thing in CryptID here is a completely random number: %var%
